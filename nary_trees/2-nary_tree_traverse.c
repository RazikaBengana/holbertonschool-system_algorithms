/**
 * nary_tree_traverse_helper - a recursive helper function designed to perform
 * depth-first traversal on an N-ary tree
 *
 * this function applies a specified action to each node, tracking and updating
 * the maximum depth encountered;
 * it calls itself recursively for each child of the current node, incrementing
 * the depth at each level;
 * if the current node's depth exceeds the known maximum, it updates the
 * maximum depth accordingly;
 * it ensures every node in the tree is visited, applying the action function
 * at each step
 *
 * @node: the current node being visited in the traversal
 * @action: a callback function to be executed on each node, which takes the
 *          node and its depth as arguments
 * @depth: the depth of the current node in the tree, starting from 0 for
 *         the root
 * @max_depth: a pointer to the maximum depth encountered during the traversal,
 *             updated throughout the recursion
 *
 * Return: nothing (void)
